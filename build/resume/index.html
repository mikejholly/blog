<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>I have exceptional breadth and depth when it comes to software and product design. I started my career writing C and Java (3 years) and I&#39;ve been working with PHP (12 years), Ruby (7 years) and JavaScript (12 years) for some time.</p>
<p>For 5 years (2008-2013), I was the lead engineer (and later CTO) at Strutta, a social promotions platform. During my time there I built the majority of the product and infrastructure (promotion builder, applications and analytics suite). The company was recently acquired for $10M.</p>
<p>I&#39;m a programming language enthusiast and I&#39;ve studied functional languages as well (Lisp, Haskell, Scala etc.). I&#39;m currently very excited about the Node.js community (2 years) and I&#39;ve written a few high-scale services and web applications with it. On the JVM, I prefer Clojure or Scala.</p>
