## Overview

I have exceptional breadth and depth when it comes to software development and product design. I started my career writing C and Java (3 years) and I've been working with PHP (12 years), Ruby (7 years), Python (3 years) and JavaScript (12 years) for some time.

For 5 years (2008-2013), I was the lead engineer (and later CTO) at Strutta, a social promotions platform. During my time there I built the majority of the product and infrastructure (promotion builder, applications and analytics suite). The company was recently acquired for $10M.

I'm a programming language enthusiast and I've studied functional languages as well (Lisp, Haskell, Scala etc.). I'm currently very excited about the Node.js community (3 years) and I've written a few high-scale services and web applications with it. On the JVM, I prefer Clojure (1 year).
